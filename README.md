# Guess-My-Number

#### Description:

This program represents a number guessing game in which the player has to try to guess a randomly chosen number. The player has 20 attempts to guess the correct number and their score will be reduced by 1 if they enter an incorrect number. If the player guesses the correct number, the game wins and their score remains unchanged. If the player finishes all 20 tries without guessing the correct number, the game loses and the score is reset to 0. The player can then click the "Again" button to start a new game. There is also a high score function that saves and displays the highest score achieved.
